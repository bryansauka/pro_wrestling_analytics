    "This analysis explores data from professional wrestling events to identify trends in event frequency, attendance, and promotion activity over time. The data includes detailed information on event dates, promotions, locations, match types, outcomes, and attendance, providing a comprehensive view of the professional wrestling landscape. By examining these variables, the analysis aims to uncover patterns in how events are organized, broadcast, and received by fans.\n",

    "- **Source:** The raw event and match data was scraped from cagematch.net using Python, loaded into BigQuery, then cleaned and modeled using dbt (data build tool)\n",
    "- **Data Range:** Covers data from 1/2021 through 6/2025\n",
    "- **Filters:** Focuses on the event types (TV-Shows, Pay Per Views and Premium Live Events) for both promotions. Matches with 0 event attendance were removed\n",
    "- **Size:** Each record in this dataset represents a wrestling match leaving 5,150 records\n",

    "\n",
    "The data cleaning and modeling process was performed using dbt, following a structured approach to ensure data quality and usability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Staging Layer:**  \n",
    "  Raw data from cagematch.net was loaded and cleaned, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats for dates and categorical fields\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimension and Fact Tables:**  \n",
    "  Cleaned data was modeled into dimension tables (e.g., arenas, events, locations, matches) and fact tables (e.g., match durations, event attendance) to support analysis and reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reporting Layer:**  \n",
    "  Final reporting tables were created by joining fact and dimension tables, providing a user-friendly and analysis-ready dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation:**  \n",
    "  Data was validated at each step to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "This layered dbt workflow ensures a transparent, reproducible, and well-organized data pipeline, resulting in a high-quality dataset for analysis.\n",

    "### 1. Executive Summary  \n",
    "**Observations**\n",
    "- Avg attendance is going in opposite directions for each promotion\n",
    "  - AEW has been on the decline YoY since 2021\n",
    "  - WWE has been on the rise YoY since 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "Thoughts: The arrival of CM Punk to AEW created buzz and added star power to the promotion in 9/2021. It was his first return to action after a 7 year absence. This buzz contributed to the higher avg attendance for AEW during that time period. CM Punk departed AEW in 9/2023 for WWE. WWE also joined the TKO umbrella in 9/2023 which opened up more opportunities and reach for the promotion\n",

    "**Avg Attendance Over Time**\n",
    "![summary table events](images/avg_attendance_by_month.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event counts for WWE remain steady YoY while AEW coninues to add a large number of events each year\n",
    "\n",
    "Thoughts: AEW could be burning out its fan base by continuing to add events and over-exposing their stars \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Geographic Distribution  \n",
    "**Observations**\n",
    "- AEW had success in London, England. The 2 events held there attracted 6x the avg audience size compared to their next highest avg attendance. AEW has not captured the same avg attendance magic outside of London\n",
    "- WWE has success everywhere it goes. The avg attendance is steady amongst the top locations\n",
    "\n",
    "Thoughts: WWE has much stronger brand recognition\n",

    "### 3. Event Distribution  \n",
    "**Observations**\n",
    "- The big events attract the large audiences for both promotions. Pay Per View (for AEW) and Premium Live Events (for WWE)\n",
    "- All of the events below list the largest events for each promotion \n",

    "### 5. Match Distribution  \n",
    "**Observations**\n",
    "- Both promotions follow a similar match duration distribution, with a large % of matches taking between 10-15 min to complete\n",
    "- Wrestlers compete in matches between 20-30 times per year (on avg)\n",
    "- The titles that are considered \"working titles\" are the titles most competed over (AEW: TNT & TBS titles; WWE: US & Intercontinental titles). The World title is rarely defended between promotions\n",
    "\n",
    "Toughts: Wrestlers usually only appear and compete on their respective weekly shows, so they have the opportunity to compete 52 weeks per year + about 10-12 PPV/PLE events per year (65 matches total per year). This table can be used as a wrestler health gauge. The more matches a wrestler has, the healthier they are to comepete. The limited number of matches per wrestler can be due to limiting wrestler exposure to avoid fatigue of seeing the same thing over and over again. \n",
